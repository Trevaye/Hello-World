# Overview

## Description

As a software engineer, I am focused on enhancing my skills and understanding of different programming languages and software development practices. This project is part of my effort to expand my knowledge of development tools and processes, including code versioning with Git and collaboration using GitHub.

The software I developed is a basic "Hello World" program that prints a welcoming message to the user. It serves as a foundational exercise to ensure I have a working development environment and can successfully execute simple programs.

The purpose of creating this software was to practice using Git and GitHub for version control, as well as to familiarize myself with the process of creating and managing repositories. By completing this project, I have improved my ability to work with Git and prepared myself for more complex projects in the future.
